gw0rp is an entry in uDevGames 2008.

Because gw0rp is being written for a contest on a tight deadline, things change rapidly. Some of this code is rather incestuous. Sorry. I plan to release the juicy bits one at a time in self-contained modules.

To run, you need the pyglet, pymunk, yaml, lepton, and psyco libraries. You need to put lepton, pymunk, and psyco in the source folder to build the app package.

The stable version of pymunk will *not* run with gw0rp. You must use the included version, though you may need to compile the shared library for your platform.
