gw0rp_subverted: Ph3ge! Don't release the nerve gas!
ph3ge: Gw0rp? Is that you? But I'm trying to free you from these beasts. I'm doing this to help you.
gw0rp_subverted: But don't you see? I am free. And these creatures aren't beasts.  They may be made out of meat, but they can think just like we can.
ph3ge: How can you say that, held prisoner down here in this animal hive?  Have you forgotten who your real friends are in the decades that they've held you here?

gw0rp_subverted: I know where I am, I know who I am, and this is where I want to stay. These animals are intelligent.  They have emotions and love and hate and cry.  Are you so sure of yourself that you can't look around?  Where exactly do you think you are?
ph3ge: We're on planet OUFP1993. A planet covered with rich silicon crust and an extremely rare molten iron core.  Think how much profit we can make if we just say that there isn't any intelligent life here and strip mine this place! These stupid meat animals don't deserve their jewel-filled home. Come back with me. Come back to vn4n.

gw0rp_subverted: ... I can't do that, not if it means letting you slaughter all these good creatures.  They don't deserve to die. It would be murder. 
ph3ge: You... You're insane. Animals don't have a soul, so humanely killing them isn't a crime. These beasts must be controlling you. I have to break their control over you.  I will release the nerve gas into the hive ventilation!
