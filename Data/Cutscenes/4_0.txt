ph3ge: Vn4n, use the matter transmitter on my ship to send down some nerve gas. 
vn4n: A what? What for?
ph3ge: I think gw0rp was imprisoned in this underground hive. With a neurotoxin, I can cull all of the infesting animals without harming myself, him, or any other cybernetic intelligences here.
vn4n: If it'll bring gw0rp back, then I'll do it.

vn4n: Will the animals suffer?
ph3ge:  No, nerve gas kills instantly.  It's very humane.
