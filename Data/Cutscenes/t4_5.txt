gw0rp_subverted: You shouldn't be here. This world no longer welcomes you.  
ph3ge: Quiet, gw0rp.  You're not in your right mind. The profit we make on this trip will make us rich for years and years.  
gw0rp_subverted: But at what opportunity cost? 
ph3ge: Always look out for yourself, gw0rp, because no one else will. I've learned that the hard way, again and again.

gw0rp_subverted: You are lost, adrift without meaning or purpose! No profit is worth the slaughter of innocents!  
ph3ge: These weren't people, gw0rp, they were beasts.  Animals. You seem to have contracted a bad case of empathy. I brought the necessary equipment to correct that.
