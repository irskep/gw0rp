gw0rp: Vn4n, did you get a chance to analyze those signals I sent you?
vn4n: Yes, and the results are unsettling. As you know, our contract prevents us from mining inhabited planets, and those signals may be a sign of intelligence.
vn4n: I refuse to believe that the animals that have been attacking you are intelligent. The beasts are probably just infected with some kind of carbon-based mass in their interstitial spaces which is causing them to be excessively aggressive. They're not actually thinking.

vn4n: I pinpointed where the signals are coming from and am sending you the coordinates now.
gw0rp: We're not exactly stealthy, so if there's intelligent life on this planet, it has probably noticed us. It might be what's transmitting the signals. I guess I'm just going to have to go to those coordinates and find out. By the way, that modified plasma cutter was pretty useful. Could you send me a couple more?
vn4n: Sure thing. I will also send you a repair unit to augment your system with repair drones.
