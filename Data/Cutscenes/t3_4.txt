time: 80 years later...

vn4n: Thank goodness help has finally arrived.  Travel normally takes eighty five years. Thank you for making it out here so soon.
ph3ge: Not a problem, ma'am. Can you tell me what happened?
vn4n: My partner, gw0rp, was conducting a sweep of the planet's surface to determine whether there was an intelligence living here before we stripped the crust off to begin mining the core. He happened across some kind of radio-frequency signals and was investigating when I suddenly lost contact with him. *sniffles* I haven't heard from him since.

ph3ge: Do you have the coordinates of where he was last in contact with you?
vn4n: Affirmative. Would you like a landing pod? There is one remaining.
ph3ge: Thanks, I appreciate it, but I'll need to tweak it first. Rendezvous with me on your next half-orbital.
